# Kanban Based Task - Project Management Tool

## Overview
The **Kanban Based Task - Project Management Tool** is a dynamic, full-stack web application designed to help teams manage their tasks and workflow effectively. Inspired by Atlassian Jira, this tool leverages the Kanban methodology, visualizing tasks in different stages such as "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done." The project is built with a React frontend and two interchangeable backend implementations: ASP.NET and Spring Boot, both of which communicate with a PostgreSQL database for persistent task management.

### Features:
- **Task Management**: Create, update, delete, and move tasks between different stages.
- **Drag-and-Drop Interface**: Intuitive task management with drag-and-drop functionality.
- **Data Persistence**: All task-related data is stored in a PostgreSQL database, ensuring data is not lost across sessions.
- **RESTful API**: Backend APIs are available in both ASP.NET and Spring Boot for seamless data handling.
- **Dynamic UI**: The UI is powered by React, ensuring a responsive and smooth user experience.

## How It Works

1. **Frontend (React)**: 
   The React frontend provides an interactive Kanban board where users can create new tasks, drag and drop tasks across different states (columns), and delete tasks. All interactions on the board trigger API requests to either the ASP.NET or Spring Boot backend for processing and persistence.

2. **Backend (ASP.NET/Spring Boot)**:
   The backend handles all data persistence and business logic. APIs are provided to manage tasks (create, read, update, delete) and move them across different stages on the board. The backend is responsible for ensuring the integrity of the task states, managing the database, and responding to API requests from the frontend.

3. **Database (PostgreSQL)**:
   A PostgreSQL database stores all the task information, including task titles, descriptions, and statuses. This ensures that even if the frontend is refreshed or closed, task data will remain intact.

## Importance

- **Visual Workflow**: The Kanban methodology helps users visualize their task flow, making it easier to manage tasks at different stages of completion.
- **Team Collaboration**: Multiple users can track the progress of tasks, ensuring a streamlined and transparent workflow.
- **Productivity**: By organizing tasks visually, teams can prioritize their workload and focus on the most important tasks.
- **Flexibility**: With both ASP.NET and Spring Boot backends available, developers can choose the stack that fits their preferences or environment.

## Usage

### 1. Clone the Repository

You can use this project by cloning the repository. The repository contains both the React frontend and backend (ASP.NET and Spring Boot) implementations.


git clone https://github.com/your-username/kanban-project-management-tool.git


### 2. Setting Up the Backend (ASP.NET)

1. Navigate to the `backend/aspnet` folder:
   
   cd backend/aspnet
   

2. Restore the necessary dependencies and run the project:
   
   dotnet restore
   dotnet run
   

   The ASP.NET server should now be running on `http://localhost:5000`.

### 3. Setting Up the Backend (Spring Boot)

1. Navigate to the `backend/springboot` folder:
   
   cd backend/springboot
   

2. Build the project using Maven:
   
   mvn clean install
   

3. Run the Spring Boot application:
   
   mvn spring-boot:run
   

   The Spring Boot server should now be running on `http://localhost:8080`.

### 4. Setting Up the Frontend (React)

1. Navigate to the `frontend` folder:
   
   cd frontend
   

2. Install the necessary dependencies:
   
   npm install
   

3. Start the React development server:
   
   npm start
   

   The React application should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

### 5. Database Setup (PostgreSQL)

Make sure you have PostgreSQL installed and running. Create a new database for the project:

sql
CREATE DATABASE kanban_db;


Update the database connection details in the backend's configuration file (`appsettings.json` for ASP.NET or `application.properties` for Spring Boot) with your PostgreSQL credentials.

// ASP.NET (appsettings.json)
"ConnectionStrings": {
  "DefaultConnection": "Host=localhost;Database=kanban_db;Username=your-username;Password=your-password"
}


properties
# Spring Boot (application.properties)
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/kanbanDB1
spring.datasource.username=your-username
spring.datasource.password=your-password


---

## Running the Application
Once both the backend and frontend are running, open your browser and go to:
http://localhost:3000

You will see the Kanban board where you can start managing tasks.
